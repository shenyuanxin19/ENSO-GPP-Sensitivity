# ENSO-GPP-Sensitivity

## Scientific question and hypothesis

This study investigates how the **El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)** affects the interannual variability of tropical terrestrial carbon flux (**GPP**). Specifically, we aim to understand if **solar radiation management (SRM)** geoengineering can effectively reduce the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystems to ENSO under high-CO₂ conditions. We hypothesize that geoengineering will significantly reduce ENSO's negative impact on tropical ecosystems by controlling temperature increases caused by elevated CO₂ levels.

## Data sources

We use climate simulation data from the **Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM5)**, provided by **CMIP6** and **GeoMIP**, under three climate scenarios:

- **piControl** (pre-industrial baseline)
- **abrupt-4×CO₂** (high-CO₂ warming scenario)
- **G1** (geoengineering scenario with SRM cooling)

The variables analyzed include:

- **Sea Surface Temperature (tos)**
- **Gross Primary Productivity (gpp)**
- **Precipitation (pr)**
- **Near-surface air temperature (tas)**

## Planned analysis

1. Calculate and visualize **ENSO indices** (DJF Niño3.4 SST anomalies) and annual variations of tropical terrestrial carbon flux (**GPP**), comparing their variability across three climate scenarios (piControl, abrupt-4×CO₂, and G1).

2. Quantify the **sensitivity of GPP to ENSO events** using linear regression, identifying differences in ENSO–GPP relationships among the three scenarios.

3. Conduct **spatial distribution and attribution analyses** to identify regional differences in ENSO–GPP sensitivity and examine underlying drivers (**temperature and precipitation**) responsible for changes in sensitivity under the geoengineering scenario (SRM).
